# BB8
Model BB8 robot as seen in Star Wars. 

_Note: This project is still in progress._

There are two major parts:
1) The hamster ball with an Arduiono controlled buggy inside
2) The head with a Raspberry Pi control unit. The Raspberry Pi control is optional if you don't want an autonomous/smart bot.

Planned features for final BB8:
* Choice between joystick control or semi-autonomous motion
* Raspberry Pi with pi camera will detect human shapes and instruct bot to follow first one it sees
* Raspberry Pi will access a home assistant API and give real answers to questions. API output will be translated to morse code with pitch and frequency modulations to make it really sound like BB8.
